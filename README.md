## A new fork and a few modifications :
- removed the dd() function and the error caused when email is already taken.
- added a parameter to select if the SMTP connection should use SSL.

## Update (01-28-2016) => A Message from Austin (previous fork's owner)
I wanted to let everyone know that this package is depreciated in support of the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com). I will offer security updates, when someone files a pull-request or when someone files an issue to make me aware of the issue.

I also want to give anyone who has never used composer a chance to understand the process of setting up this process. 

1. First and foremost you'll want to [get composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
2. Once you have composer you'll want to create a `composer.json` file similar to the following in your project directory. ie: if you're creating your website in the directory `/var/www/html/myproject`, than your project root will be that directory. So the file will be located here `/var/www/html/myproject/composer.json`.
```json
{
    "name": "YOURNAME/YOURprojectName",
    "description": "Please describe your project here..",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Your Name",
            "email": "youremail@example.com",
            "homepage":"http://example.com",
            "role": "Developer"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "php": ">=5.3.7"
    },
    "require-dev": {
        "austinkregel/php-login-advanced": "dev-master"
    },
    "minium-stability": "dev"
}
```
3. Once you have the file created, issue the `composer install` command. Which will then install the desired project. Now we can move onto the creation of the `config.php` file. Which will override the default connections to the database as well as the defaults for ReCaptcha. The default config is recommended to look something like this:
```php
<?php 
return array(
  'DB_HOST' => 'localhost',
  'DB_NAME' => 'YOUR_DB', 
  'DB_USER' => 'YOUR_USER',
  'DB_PASS'=> 'YOUR_PASSWORD',
  'SITE_URL'=> 'example.com',
  'RECAPTCHA_SITEKEY' => 'YOUR_SITE_KEY',
  'RECAPTCHA_SECRETKEY'=>'YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
);
```
4. Now we have the config set up, as well as the default packages.
```php
<?php 
error_reporting(E_ALL); 
ini_set("display_errors", 1); 

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$login = new Login\PHPLogin(dirname(__DIR__).'/master-fork/config.php');
$dir = 'vendor/austinkregel/php-login-advanced';

include $dir. '/views/_header.php';

// show the registration form
if (isset($_GET['register']) && ! $login->isRegistrationSuccessful() && 
   ($login->config->ALLOW_USER_REGISTRATION || ($login->config->ALLOW_ADMIN_TO_REGISTER_NEW_USER && $_SESSION['user_access_level'] == 255))) {
    include $dir. ('/views/register.php');
// show the request-a-password-reset or type-your-new-password form
} else if (isset($_GET['password_reset']) && ! $login->isPasswordResetSuccessful()) {
    if (isset($_REQUEST['user_name']) && isset($_REQUEST['verification_code']) && $login->isPasswordResetLinkValid()) {
        // reset link is correct: ask for the new password
        include $dir. ("/views/password_reset.php");
    } else {
        // no data from a password-reset-mail has been provided, 
        // we show the request-a-password-reset form
        include $dir. ('/views/password_reset_request.php');
    }

// show the edit form to modify username, email or password
} else if (isset($_GET['edit']) && $login->isUserLoggedIn()) {
    include $dir. ('/views/edit.php');

// the user is logged in, we show informations about the current user
} else if ($login->isUserLoggedIn()) {
    include $dir. ('/views/logged_in.php');

// the user is not logged in, we show the login form
} else {
    include $dir. ('/views/not_logged_in.php');
}

include $dir. ('/views/_footer.php');
```

 5. Congratulations, we have set everything up that we need. Now you should be able to visit your website and have the option to login. If you have any errors or issues, please file an "Issue" located within the issue tab on the top of this page. Or if you would prefer, grab my email from [my website](https://austinkregel.com)
 
Thank you for using this script!!

## A Message from Austin (previous fork's owner)
 
I wanted to note that I am thinking about updating the stylings, I think it looks a little out dated compaired to my other works (I know I didn't style it but I still claim this fork) So I am going to launch several branches listed below.
  
  +  ~~Make a verison for Bootstrap~~ [Bootstrap version](https://github.com/austinkregel/php-login-advanced/tree/bootstrap-master)
  +  Make a Flat UI version
  +  Make a Material Design version
  +  Make a simple, or little css version

I plan to make these changes because I have recieved several emails asking for help, and I don't feel right installing this script, I honestly don't so to make myself feel better about it all, I will be making my own changes and then I can claim this as (partially) my own.

If there is a design style you like that I didn't list above or you can't find anywhere else, email me either from [my website](http://austinkregel.com) or from my [github email](http://github.com/austinkregel) located on my github page and link a few images featuring the design so I know how to design it. 

## A PHP login script (ADVANCED VERSION)

This script is base on [PHP-Login-Advanced](https://github.com/panique/php-login-advanced) which is not maintained anymore.

Please note that this is a [Composer based](https://getcomposer.org) application. Once composer is intalled on your server, run `composer install` in the directory of this app. It will then install the requirements, you can now follow the instructions below.

## Live-demo

A live demo can be seen here at [austinkregel.com](http://php-login.austinkregel.com/). Please note that the database, truncates (deletes all data) from itself every 2 weeks.


A simple, but secure PHP login script with many features includes :
- users can register, login, logout (with username or email, password)
- captcha
- account verification via mail
- password reset
- edit user data (password, username, email)
- "remember me" / stay logged in cookies
- **"remember me" supports parallel login from multiple devices <- NEW**
- **i18n/internationalization: English, French at the moment but it's easy to add a new language <- NEW**
- **possibility to manage some user access levels <- NEW**
- **a beautiful CSS style <-NEW**
- gravatars

IT stuffs...
- PDO used for database access
- mail sending via PHPMailer (SMTP or PHP's mail() function/linux sendmail)
- Uses the ultra-modern & future-proof PHP 5.5.BLOWFISH hashing/salting functions (includes the official PHP 5.3 & PHP 5.4 compatibility pack, which makes those functions available in those versions too)

You can also visit [Professional MVC Version](https://github.com/panique/php-login) if you look for a MVC Framework Version.
 
## Requirements

- PHP 5.3.7+
- MySQL 5 database (please use a modern version of MySQL (5.5, 5.6, 5.7) as very old versions have a exotic bug that
[makes PDO injections possible](http://stackoverflow.com/q/134099/1114320).
- activated PHP's GD graphic functions (the tutorial shows how)
- enabled OpenSSL module (the tutorial shows how)
- this version uses mail sending, so you need to have an **SMTP mail sending account** somewhere OR you know how to get
 **linux's sendmail** etc. to run. As it's nearly impossible to send real mails with PHP's mail() function (due to
 anti-spam blocking of nearly every major mail provider in the world) you should really use SMTP mail sending.

## Installation (quick setup)
* 1. install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
* 2. execute `composer install` or execute `composer require austinkregel/php-login-advanced`
* 3. create database *login* and tables *users* and *user_connections* via the SQL statements in the `_installation` folder.
* 4. Create a file somewhere for a custom configuration, in the file at least *DB_USER*, *DB_PASS*, *DB_NAME*, *DB_HOST*, *RECAPTCHA_SITEKEY* and *RECAPTCHA_SECRETKEY*. That file MUST return an array so it should look like the file at the end of this list.
* 5. You need the cookie valid for just a domain (and subdomains) add to the config *COOKIE_DOMAIN*  your domain name (and don't forget to put the dot in front of the domain!)
* 6. it's recommended that you also add *COOKIE_SECRET_KEY* to the file and make it some random string. This will make your cookies more secure by changing it from the default
* 7. as this version uses email sending, you'll need to a) provide an SMTP account in the config OR b) install a mail server tool on your server, by default we use the [php mail()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php) function.
It's recommeneded you use a real SMTP provider. Sending emails manually via mail() is something for hardcore admins.
Usually mails sent via mail() will never reach the receiver. Please also don't try weird Gmail setups, this can fail to a lot of reasons.

- To enable OpenSSL, follow [this tutorial for Ubuntu / Debian](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu) and [this tutorial for Fedora / CentOS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-centos-6)
- Extra packages that are recommended to install
  - php5-mcrypt
  - php5-cgi 
  - php5-curl 
  - php5-gd 
  - php5-json 
  - 
## Troubleshooting & useful stuff

Please use a real SMTP provider for sending mail. Using something like gmail.com or even trying to send mails via
mail() will bring you into a lot of problems (unless you really really know what you are doing). Sending mails is a
huge topic. But if you still want to use Gmail: Gmail is very popular as an SMTP mail sending service and would
work for smaller projects, but sometimes gmail.com will not send mails anymore, usually because of:

1. "SMTP Connect error": PHPMailer says "smtp login failed", but login is correct: Gmail.com thinks you are a spammer. You'll need to
"unlock" your application for gmail.com by logging into your gmail account via your browser, go to http://www.google.com/accounts/DisplayUnlockCaptcha
and then, within the next 10 minutes, send an email via your app. Gmail will then white-list your app server.
Have a look here for full explanaition: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/14257?p=client_login&rd=1

2. "SMTP data quota exceeded": gmail blocks you because you have sent more than 500 mails per day (?) or because your users have provided
 too much fake email addresses. The only way to get around this is renting professional SMTP mail sending, prices are okay, 10.000 mails for $5.

3. Please make sure that you have port 25 and / or port 587 open on your server, other wise your mail will never leave your server.
## Security notice

This script comes with a handy .htaccess in the views folder that denies direct access to the files within the folder
(so that people cannot render the views directly). However, these .htaccess files only work if you have set
`AllowOverride` to `All` in your apache vhost configs. There are lots of tutorials on the web on how to do this.

## How this script works

If you look into the code and at the file/folder-structure everything should be self-explaining. If it's not please ask a question in the [issues section](https://github.com/austinkregel/php-login-advanced/issues).
